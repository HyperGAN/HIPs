This is the suggested template for new HIPs.

Note that an HIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `hip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

## Simple Summary
If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the HIP.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
Why would this be a good addition?  Keep it brief, if possible.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any HIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the HIP is 'Accepted'.  This section should explain how to run the HIP, when the status becomes "Implemented".
